# Scala Contact Form: Because Someone Has to Listen!

Welcome to Scala Contact Form, where even your spam gets a warm welcome! This app saves your precious details (Name, Email, Phone) and stores them safely in an SQLite DB, because we believe in the power of saving contact info… for eternity.

Oh, and after thanking you (because manners matter), it politely sends you back to the homepage in 3 seconds, because we’re not clingy. 🚀

## Features

- A contact form so simple, even your grandma could fill it out (and we hope she does).
- Uses Scala and SQLite – because, why not? You’ve got to stay classy with Scala.
- Stylish Bootstrap 5 form – because ugly forms don’t get contacts.
- A thank-you page with a 3-second delay. Why 3 seconds? Because 2 felt too rushed, and 4 is just too long.

## How It Works

1. You type. (Name, Email, and Phone)
2. You submit. (Press that sweet “Submit” button)
3. We save. (Into our mighty local SQLite DB, aka “The Contact Vault”)
4. We thank you. (And show you our gratitude with a thank-you page)
5. We part ways. (After 3 seconds, you’re out. No strings attached.)

## Quickstart

If you want to run this app and save some contact details (no judgment), here’s what you do:

1. Clone this repo (no, seriously, go ahead).
