📞 Scala Contact Form - Because Someone Has to Listen!

Welcome to Scala Contact Form, where even your spam gets a warm welcome! This app saves your precious details (Name, Email, Phone) and stores them safely in an SQLite DB, because we believe in the power of saving contact info… for eternity.

Oh, and after thanking you (because manners matter), it politely sends you back to the homepage in 3 seconds, because we’re not clingy. 🚀

🎨 Features

	- A contact form so simple, even your grandma could fill it out (and we hope she does).
	- Uses Scala and SQLite – because, why not? You’ve got to stay classy with Scala.
	- Stylish Bootstrap 5 form – because ugly forms don’t get contacts.
	- A thank-you page with a 3-second delay. Why 3 seconds? Because 2 felt too rushed, and 4 is just too long.

🛠️ How It Works

	1.	You type. (Name, Email, and Phone)
	2.	You submit. (Press that sweet “Submit” button)
	3.	We save. (Into our mighty local SQLite DB, aka “The Contact Vault”)
	4.	We thank you. (And show you our gratitude with a thank-you page)
	5.	We part ways. (After 3 seconds, you’re out. No strings attached.)

🚀 Quickstart

	If you want to run this app and save some contact details (no judgment), here’s what you do:

	1.	Clone this repo (no, seriously, go ahead).

	```
	git clone https://github.com/your-cool-username/scala-contact-form.git
    cd scala-contact-form
    ```



    2.	Install Scala and sbt, unless you’re already a Scala wizard 🧙‍♂️.
	3.	Run the app with sbt (because running is good for health).

    ```
    sbt run

    ```

    4.	Open your browser and visit:

    ```
    http://localhost:8080

    ```

    5.	Fill out the form, and bask in the glory of that Thank You message.

🧙‍♂️ Magical Dependencies

		- Scala: Because it’s like Java, but fancier and makes you feel smarter.
		- SQLite: Keeps your contacts locked in a vault… on your local machine. No cloud nonsense here.
		- Bootstrap 5: Forms have never looked this good, seriously.


🚨 Warning

	We take no responsibility if:

		- You end up contacting yourself.
		- Your details get saved more times than you can count.
		- You get so mesmerized by the thank-you page that you lose track of time.

🤔 Why Build This?

		- Because Scala deserves more love (and more contact forms).
		- Because your contacts are lonely and need a good home.

🦄 Special Thanks

		- To Scala, for making us feel smarter.
		- To SQLite, for holding onto the contacts like a true champ.
		- To Bootstrap, for making things look pretty with zero effort.

Now go ahead, fill out that form – the Thank You page is waiting. 😎
